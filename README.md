# BeerML

## Description
This iOS application uses **Coreml** and *convolutional neural network model* in order to predict several types of beer bottles and cans.

## Model
The current version has a trained model with approximately 1,700 images and 7,000 iterations. There is a loss of 1.67.

## Scripts
In the Scripts for training model directory you can find different helper scripts needed to prepare the training data set.
There is a script called **script3.py** which parses both json and xml files into **Turicreate** format in order to fit the model.

## Examples
In the examples folder there are both json and xml files that match the script parsing.
